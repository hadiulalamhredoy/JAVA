Key Features of Java

Platform Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere):
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This means Java programs can run on any device or operating system that has a JVM installed.

Object-Oriented:
Java is built around objects and classes, making code reusable and modular.

Strongly Typed:
Variables must have declared data types, and type-checking is strict.

Automatic Memory Management:
Java has a built-in garbage collector that automatically manages memory, freeing developers from manual memory allocation and deallocation.

Robust and Secure:
Java has strong error handling and security features that make it suitable for large and critical applications.
